# Deploy Firestore Rules

## IMPORTANT: Deploy the updated Firestore rules immediately!

The new account is still seeing private posts because the Firestore rules haven't been deployed yet.

### Steps to Deploy:

1. **Using Firebase CLI:**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

2. **Using Firebase Console:**
   - Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules
   - Copy the content from `firestore.rules` file
   - Click "Publish"

3. **Verify Deployment:**
   - Check the Firebase Console to ensure rules are active
   - Test with a new account to verify private posts are filtered

### Current Rule Changes:

- ✅ **Enhanced security logic** with better error handling
- ✅ **Client-side backup filtering** added for immediate protection
- ✅ **Improved rule syntax** using `hasAll()` and `get()` with defaults

### Testing:

After deployment, create a new account and verify:
- ❌ Private community posts should NOT be visible
- ✅ General posts should be visible
- ✅ Public community posts should be visible
- ✅ New user welcome message should appear when no posts available

**The client-side filtering is now active as a backup, but Firestore rules deployment is still required for optimal security and performance.**
